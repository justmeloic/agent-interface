# --- Production Environment Variables for Next.js Frontend ---

# These variables are used by the Next.js build process.
# Note: For production builds, API calls are made using relative paths,
# so NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL is intentionally commented out.

# Host for the backend API. Not used in production build, but kept for consistency.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST=http://localhost

# Port for the backend API. Not used in production build.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PORT=8000

# The base URL for API calls.
# This is commented out to ensure the production build uses relative paths,
# as the frontend is served from the same origin as the backend.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST}:${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PORT} 

# Secret used for authentication purposes (e.g., next-auth).
# IMPORTANT: This should be a strong, unique secret for your production environment.
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret
